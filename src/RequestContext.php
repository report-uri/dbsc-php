/**
 * Everything the library needs to know about the inbound request, decoupled from any HTTP
 * framework. The host application builds one of these from its own request object.
 *
 *  - `sessionId` is the host application's stable authenticated-session identifier (e.g. the
 *    session-cookie value). DBSC state is keyed by it. It MUST be the same value across the
 *    post-login navigation and the registration POST, and it MUST NOT itself live inside a
 *    read-modify-written shared session blob.
 *  - `userId` is recorded on the binding and in audit events; pass '' if not yet known.
 *  - `originHostUrl` is the scheme+host (e.g. `https://example.com`) for the DBSC scope.
